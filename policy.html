                    <span class="fw-bolder">The right to be informed: </span>
                    this means we must inform you of how we intend to use your personal data and we do this through the

                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">The right of access: </span>
                    this means you have the right to request access to the data we hold about you and we must respond to
                    those requests within one month. You can do this by sending an email to Karen Lee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">The right to rectification:  </span>
                    this means that if you believe some of the data we hold is incorrect, you have the right to have it
                    corrected. You can do this by logging into your account with us, or by sending us an email with your
                    request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">The right to erasure:</span>
                    this means you can request that the information we hold be deleted, and we will comply unless we
                    have a compelling reason not to, in which case you will be informed of the same. You can do this by
                    sending an email to Karen Lee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">The right to restrict processing: </span>

                    can do this by sending an email to <a href="info@trippian.com">info@trippian.com</a>.

                    wish to request a copy of your information, contact us at Karen Lee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">The right to object: </span>
                    this means you can file a formal objection with us regarding our use of your information with regard
                    to third parties, or its processing where our legal basis is our legitimate interest in it. To do
                    this, please send an email to Karen Lee.

                Loft Science LLC takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information
                via the application, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect
                sensitive information (eg. credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us
                in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for
                "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.

            <p class="mb-3">
                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your
                information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
                billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers
                and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This
                is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's
                personal information under our control.

                The company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications to build
                users' trust and confidence in the internet and application use by providing simple and secure access
                and communication of credit card and personal information. In addition, Loft Science LLC is a licensee

                If you answered "yes" to the question Does your website comply with the General Data Protection
                Regulation ("GDPR")? then the Privacy Policy above includes language that is meant to account for such
                compliance. Nevertheless, in order to be fully compliant with GDPR regulations your company must fulfill
                other requirements such as: (i) doing an assessment of data processing activities to improve security;
                (ii) have a data processing agreement with any third party vendors: (iii) appoint a data protection
                officer for the company to monitor GDPR compliance; (iv) designate a representative based in the EU
                under certain circumstances; and (v) have a protocol in place to handle a potential data breach. For
                more details on how to make sure your company is fully compliant with GDPR, please visit the official

            <h4 class="mb-3 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline">COPPA Compliance Disclosure: </h4>
            <p class="mb-3">This Privacy Policy presumes that your website is not directed at children under the age of
                13 and does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from them or allow others to do the
                same through your site. If this is not true for your website or online service and you do collect such
                information (or allow others to do so), please be aware that you must be compliant with all COPPA
                regulations and guidelines in order to avoid violations which could lead to law enforcement actions,
                including civil penalties.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3">
                In order to be fully compliant with COPPA your website or online service must fulfill other requirements
                such as: (i) posting a privacy policy which describes not only your practices, but also the practices of
                any others collecting personal information on your site or service — for example, plug-ins or ad
                networks; (ii) include a prominent link to your privacy policy anywhere you collect personal information
                from children; (iii) include a description of parental rights direct (e.g. that you won't require a
                child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary, that they can review their child's
                personal information, direct you to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the
                child's information, and the procedures to exercise their rights); (iv) give parents "direct notice" of
                your information practices before collecting information from their children; and (v) obtain the
                parents' "verifiable consent" before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from a child.
